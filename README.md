### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 


I am a Data Science grad student at Northeastern University, Boston MA. I have 2+ years of experience working in tech, mainly backend systems and more recently, Agentic frameworks and LLMs. I admire creativity and also daddble in art.
Outside of tech, linguistic anthropology & history in general have piqued my interest from time to time and I am avid enjoyer of simulation/sandbox video games. You can contact me through email: magadumashish99@gmail.com.



What languages do I speak?
English, Kannada (Cuh-nadda), Hindi, Marathi. I'm trying my best to learn Japanese.

Want to hear something interesting and nerdy?

{K âˆ© H} âŠ‚ S

{H - {K âˆ© S}} âŠ‚ P

While this pattern has many exceptions, what I am trying to convey here is that words in common between Kannada and Hindi, are mostly derived from Sanskrit. And if a Sanskrit loan word appears in Kannada but not in Hindi, it mostly came from Persian/Arabic.
This simple pattern reveals a lot about the history of the India subcontinent and it's diverse ethnicities.

TLDR: We can use simple reasoning to find the etymology of many words of languages from the Indian subcontinent.

I happen to be blessed with a large vocabulary coming from a diverse family of languages:
- Indo-European: English, Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit
- Dravidian: Kannada, Tamil, Telugu
- Japonic: Japanese
