### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 


I am a Data Science grad student at Northeastern University, Boston MA. I have 2+ years of experience working in tech, mainly backend systems and more recently, Agentic frameworks and LLMs. I admire creativity and also daddble in art.
Outside of tech, linguistic anthropology & history in general have piqued my interest from time to time and I am avid enjoyer of simulation/sandbox video games. You can contact me through email: magadumashish99@gmail.com.
